<ol id="disclaimer">
	<li>The first enhancement that is used on this website is an automatic slideshow, which displays each slide for 3s before changing it. The user can also navigate through the slides manually by clicking the left and right arrow buttons. Furthermore, there are dots on the bottom of the slides indicating the number of slides. The dots also work as navigation buttons as the user can use them to select the slide they want to see.<a href="index.php">("Homepage")</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aN7WnodpP4Q&t=4s">("Reference").</a></li>

	<li>An enhancement that is used on this website is a drop-down list for “Products”, which is on the navigation bar that is located on each of our webpage. This drop-down list contains the three kinds of products which are the gaming keyboards, gaming mice and gaming controllers. The JavaScript implemented here is that the drop-down list will close when the user clicks anywhere outside the list, in contrast to what we have learnt where the user must click on the product button again to close the list.<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_css_js_dropdown">("Reference").</a></li>
