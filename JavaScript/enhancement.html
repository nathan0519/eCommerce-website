<h1 id="hstyle1">Enhancement</h1>
<ol id="disclaimer">
	<li>The enhancement that we used on this website is a responsive menu bar, compared to the method we learned from the tutorial class which is a basic navigation link, the responsive menu bar looks much more attractive so that it could attract the user attention. Other than that, the responsive menu bar looks more concise than the basic navigation links especially when the user resizes the website. All our webpages on the website used a responsive menu bar.</li>

	<li>The small icon on the tab of the website which is a favicon. Even though, it is a small icon that some people might not even notice it but its also important for letting the user make sure and confirm it is our company websites. From a view of branding point, it is very important as it shows a great deal of professionalism and attention to detail to the user.</li>
	
	<li>The other enhancement that we used in our website is the hover effect on the image, so when the user is interested in that product, they will find out the effect and there is also a link provided to navigate the user to the specific product description website that will provide more details of the product which the user is interested in. Compared to what we have learned from our tutorial class which is inserted image on the website, this hover effect looks much more attractive and provide the user a new experience compared to some of the normal website.<a href="product3.html">(Logitech G502 Lightspeed inside this picture have a link to navigate the user to its product description)</a></li>

	<li>The last enhancement for our website is embedded youtube video. We embedded youtube video at our product description, as embedded video in a website can describe the product more clearly for the user and let them be more interested in the product we sell.<a href="product4.html">("Video")</a></li>
